# Denver Elixir Exercisms
Repo for mob-programming exercisms at Denver Erlang &amp; Elixir meetup

@javajolt had a great idea -- we should publish the exercises that we work
through as a group.  After all, the code belongs to all of us!

Ping me if you would like commit access -- it would also be great to see
folks adding alternate implementations so we can learn from each other.
